collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'We evaluate an informational intervention aimed at reducing student absences in a rural setting using a multi-site, blocked randomized controlled trial. Eight rural districts participating in a Rural Research Network (RRN) implemented a personalized messaging intervention in the 2020-21 school year. Districts regularly sent messages (texts, emails, or calls) to caregivers of students in 1st through 12th grade, informing them of their student’s absence rate, setting a goal or providing a comparison point for their student’s absence rate, and offering support.'
